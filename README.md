## Showroom

Showroom is an image gallery library built for Android. The aim of this library is to provide a single view component that provides an image gallery experience almost completely out-of-the-box with as little configuration from the consumer as possible. The project utilizes Kotlin and is very much in active development.

<sup>**Note: currently the project is using a Release Canditate version of the [AndroidX Core KTX library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core), this is to get access to the latest compatibility APIs that the library has to offer due to issues with immersive mode pre version 1.5.0.**</sup>

### Features

The project makes use of the following features: 

- Highly customizable
- Pre-defined customizable gallery UI 
- Optional infinite image scrolling
- Immersion toggling
- Support for API versions 21 to 30
- Simple design

### Third Party Libraries

Currently, the project also makes use the following open source libraries: 

- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) used for image loading
- [GestureViews](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/GestureViews) used for image manipulation

### Dependency

This library is currently accessible via [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#finn-no/showroom) and can therefore be used in your project by adding the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```Gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.finn-no:showroom:1.1.4-alpha'
}
```

### Setup

Please see the [sameple app](https://github.com/finn-no/showroom/tree/master/app/src/main) for a more detailed example of a suggested way to setup this project in your own app.

**Initial setup**

Showroom should be instantiated by calling the provided `attach()` function:

```Kotlin
showroom.attach((activity as AppCompatActivity), provideGalleryData())
```

Whereby `activity` must by of type `AppCompatActivity` and `provideGalleryData` must be of type `List<GalleryData>`

**Exiting the gallery**

In the case of supporting custom routines when click the 'exit' icon in the gallery the following callback is provided:

```Kotlin
showroom.setNavigationExitEvent { /** exit routine */  }
```

Further to this, Showroom provides a function to reset the activity state upon exit, you may choose to use this in, for example `onDestroy` or inside of an `onBackPressed` event: 

```Kotlin
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    showroom.restoreWindowPreGallery()
}
```

**Display cutout**

For devices running Android 9 (API level 28) and above, there is a possiblity that the device will have a cutout. Therefore it is strongly encouraged that you [support display cutouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/display-cutout) in your app. If you don't then unexpected graphical issues will occur when entering/exiting immersive mode. A suggested way to support display cutouts is by adding the following to your `MainActivity`:

```Kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.P) {
        window.attributes.layoutInDisplayCutoutMode = WindowManager.LayoutParams.LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_SHORT_EDGES
    }
}
```

### Releases

The current release is [v1.1.4-alpha](https://github.com/finn-no/showroom/releases/tag/1.1.4-alpha) found at the respective link otherwise visit [releases](https://github.com/finn-no/showroom/releases) for the complete list.
